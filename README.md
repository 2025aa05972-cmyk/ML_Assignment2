❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project builds and evaluates multiple Machine Learning models to predict the presence of heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset.

The application includes:

📊 Model comparison dashboard

🧠 Real-time patient risk prediction

📁 CSV-based model evaluation

📈 Performance visualization

The project is deployed using Streamlit for interactive user experience.

🏆 Best Performing Model
✅ XGBoost

Highest Accuracy

Highest F1 Score

Highest MCC

Strong Recall (important in medical prediction)

Although Random Forest achieved the highest AUC, XGBoost provided better overall balanced performance.

📈 Evaluation Metrics Explained

Accuracy → Overall correctness

AUC → Model’s ability to distinguish between classes

Precision → Correct positive predictions

Recall → Ability to detect disease cases

F1 Score → Balance between Precision and Recall

MCC → Balanced metric for binary classification

For medical diagnosis, Recall and F1 Score are especially important to reduce false negatives.
